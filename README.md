# Prediction-of-Passengers-Survival-in-Titanic
Titanic was a British liner ship which sank after colliding with an iceberg. It contained around 2225 passengers, out of which more than 1500 died in the collision. The project is based on predicting the people died / survived that accident using Machine Learning Algorithms and python. To create a machine learning model on the Titanic dataset, which is used by many people all over the world. It provides information on the fate of passengers on the Titanic â€“ whether they survived or not, and to visualise according to economic status (class), sex, age and survival.
